# MyNameGame

The original mission was written in Java and didn't use databinding so for this interview project I decided to start from scratch and use Kotlin and the Android Support Library with MVVM architecture.

## Your mission

Present the user with six faces and ask them to identify the listed name. To spruce things up, implement a few features of your choice.

1. Stat tracking. How many correct / incorrect attempts did the user make? How long does it take on average for a person to identify the subject?
2. Spruce up transitions and image loading.  Don't let images pop in and show the user that loading is happening
3. Game modes:
    * Mat(t) Mode. Roughly 90% of our co-workers are named Mat(t), so add a challenge mode where you only present the users with A Mat(t).
    * Reverse mode: Show one face with 5 names. Ask the user to identify the correct name.
4. Hint mode. As people wait, faces disappear until only the correct one is left.
5. Insert your own idea here!

Uses/features/stuff:
1. Kotlin
2. MVVM / databinding
3. Groupie RecyclerView adapter
4. Splash Activity
5. Retrofit
6. RXJava
7. ObjectAnimator
8. AndroidSpinKit
9. ...
